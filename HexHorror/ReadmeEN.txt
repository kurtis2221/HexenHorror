|HeXen Horror Game by Kurtis|
\===========================/

Gameplay
========
One you started the game, you can choose from 3 difficulty levels. The difference between the difficulty levels
are the enemies speed. On easy you can easily evade them, but on hard the game is a real challenge, because
you will need to use the sprint key alot.
After selecting a difficulty level, you must find a part of the sword on each level. Don't worry about the
flashlight, it won't run out of battery, but you can turn it off. After collecting one part, you will need to
find the exit of the level. I'm sure it's easy to find it, if nothing covers your view from it. When you
succesfully escaped you will get a code to that level (3 digit code), so you can continue if you get killed.
If you can get all parts of the sword, then the final challenge awaits for you...

It seems to be like a long game if you play this for the first time, but I can tell you I completed it on easy
in about 10-15 minutes.
